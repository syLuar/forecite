Case Facts *
A construction company ZK engaged DGE as a subcontractor for external facade aluminium cladding work at Changi Airport. The subcontract included provisions for liquidated damages for late completion. DGE walked off site on June 6, 2018, claiming justification due to ZK's alleged repudiation by non-payment. ZK disputes this and claims DGE's abandonment was unjustified.

Legal Question (optional)
Whether DGE's walkoff from the construction site was justified as a response to repudiatory breach by ZK, or whether it constituted an unjustified abandonment of contractual obligations?
